# Get-Binary-Tree-Height
This is an Algorithm to calculate the height of the binary tree. As recursive technique has been used to calculate the height of binary tree ,the entire problem is totally divided into small sub problems and recursive method has been used for each sub-Problem to calculate the entire height of the tree.First we calculate the left height of the tree and then calculate the right height and check the max height between the left and right plus adding the root connecting edge to calculate the entire height of the tree, We can also use the same given method the find the height of any node as well.
